# Are investments on MyKapital guaranteed?

No, as with any investment, there are inherent risks, including the potential for the management company to underperform or fail, which could lead to the loss of some or all of your invested capital. Furthermore, interest schemes may not offer easy liquidity, meaning they may not be readily sellable. Prospective investors are advised to carefully review the details of each interest scheme and conduct a thorough risk assessment before committing their funds.
